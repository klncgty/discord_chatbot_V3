# Discord ChatBot V3 #

I build this project for Miuul company and this project includes an artificial intelligence chat bot that operates on Discord. The bot can respond to users' questions with specific prompts entered on certain topics and added keywords.

- Subject Expertise: Specializes in topics such as data science, machine learning, data analysis, virtual machines, front-end development, robotics, application development, web scraping, and user interface/user experience.

- Natural Language Processing: Understands user queries well using GPT-4 and produces short and concise responses in natural language. It is also economical in terms of tokens.

- Image Recognition: Can process messages with attached screenshots and extract text from images.

- Conversation History: Remembers previous conversations with users and provides relevant responses in context.
